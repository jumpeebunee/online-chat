# Online chat
[Live Demo](https://zhigalovka-chat.netlify.app). 
A messenger application in which you can create posts, leave comments and communicate with people.

## Opportunities
You can create an account or log in to an existing one. You can create a post that all users of the site will see and be able to respond to it. It is possible to search and send messages to people. Previously, you could choose any photo and upload it to the server, but now it's paid. The application works with firebase. If the application is not working now, it means that the period of non-direct placement on firebase has ended and I have not updated it yet.

## Stack

The application is based on React + redux + typescript. <br>
I used SAAS as a prepossor.
